        <p>Mohammad Houssein Fleity,</p>

        <p>
          Born on April 17, 2002, in Ajaltoun, Keserwan, Lebanon, and originally
          hailing from Arsal, Bekaa, Lebanon, I have always been driven by an
          insatiable desire for self-improvement. Throughout my early education,
          I consistently strived for excellence, achieving top marks and being
          recognized not only for my academic prowess but also for my exemplary
          social conduct.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon graduating from high school, Lebanon was struck by an economic
          crisis followed closely by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite
          these formidable challenges, my passion for continuous development and
          success remained unwavering. This determination enabled me to once
          again excel academically, attaining a GPA of 80% at one of the most
          prestigious and rigorous universities in Lebanon and the Middle East
          <strong>The Lebanese University</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <b>highly skilled</b> computer science graduate holding an
          <b>M1 degree</b>. I possess a strong academic foundation coupled with
          a deep passion for
          <b
            >problem-solving, object-oriented programming, and analytical
            thinking</b
          >. My academic journey has equipped me with the expertise and tools
          necessary to tackle complex challenges and devise innovative
          solutions. I thrive in dynamic and challenging environments, where I
          can apply my skills to contribute effectively and drive technological
          advancements.
        </p>

        <p>
          I embody the spirit of a fighter, always ready to embrace challenges
          and consistently striving to be the best, both intellectually and
          socially. I pride myself on being polite, humble, and intelligent in
          every setting.
