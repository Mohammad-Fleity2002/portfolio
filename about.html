        <p>Mohammad Houssein Fleity,</p>

        <p>
          Born on April 17, 2002, in Ajaltoun, Keserwan, Lebanon, and originally
          from Arsal, Bekaa, I have always been driven by an insatiable desire
          for self-improvement. Throughout my early education, I consistently
          strived for excellence, earning top marks and being recognized not
          only for my academic performance but also for my strong character and
          social engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
          After graduating from high school, Lebanon was struck by an economic
          crisis followed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, my
          passion for learning and progress remained steadfast. This
          determination allowed me to excel academically, achieving a GPA of 80%
          at one of the most prestigious universities in Lebanon and the Middle
          East, <strong>The Lebanese University</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I decided to
          continue my academic journey by pursuing a Master’s degree at the same
          institution. My M1 year in Computer Science reinforced my technical
          foundation and deepened my problem-solving mindset, motivating me to
          specialize further in a field that truly inspires me ,
          <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my M2 in AI, I was introduced to cutting-edge technologies and
          advanced concepts such as Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning,
          Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision, along with modern
          topics like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Explainable AI (XAI).
          This specialization broadened my horizons and strengthened my
          technical versatility.
        </p>

        <p>
          The highlight of my academic journey was my Master’s thesis, where I
          explored the impact of topological information on enhancing
          <strong>AI-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)</strong>.
          This research allowed me to bridge two major domains, Artificial
          Intelligence and Cybersecurity, and apply theoretical knowledge to a
          real-world problem, strengthening my research and analytical skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond academics, I have continuously sought to grow through hands-on
          experience. I completed two internships, the first at
          <strong>BeyTek (Jal El Dib)</strong> as a Django Developer, where I
          secured and optimized corporate web systems, and the second at
          <strong>Nebulane</strong>, where I was introduced to the world of
          DevOps and AWS SysOps. These experiences enhanced my practical
          understanding of software development, automation, and cloud
          infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          To further validate my skills, I obtained two AWS certifications:
          <strong>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</strong> and
          <strong>AWS Certified SysOps Administrator</strong>, reflecting my
          continuous drive for improvement and commitment to excellence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking ahead, I’m eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a
          professional setting, contributing to innovative projects, solving
          complex challenges, and making a positive impact through Artificial
          Intelligence and its real-world applications.
        </p>
